# Tesimonial Grid
## Challange
This is a challange from frontendmentor.io and can be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7

## Approach
For this challange I tried to use a mobile-first approach for the first time. I used a combination of css flex and css grid. This was also my first time using rems as font size.

Please let me know any tips/concepts to better my html/css.
