            <p class="testimonial">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                                             learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p class="testimonial">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

            <p class="testimonial-highlight">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="testimonial">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                                    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                                    100% recommend! ”</p>
